 Backend APIs for admin, customer and delivery driver

To start the backend server :
1. Clone the repo.
2. Change the mongo uri in db.js
3. Install all the dependencies first using "npm i".
4. Run the server using "nodemon index.js".
5. I have included postman file "Postman testing api.json" in directory also, import it in postman.

**I have also included the examples of different responses in postman file. Please check that also.**
